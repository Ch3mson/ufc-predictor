A Jupyter Notebook that cleans a UFC dataset and utilizes 6 different machine learning models to predict future UFC fight outcomes. The models with their respected accuracies: Logistic Regression = 78.99%, Random Forest = 81.98%, Decision Trees = 77.06%, Naive Bayes Model = 74.94%, KNN = 79.26%, and CSM = 79.1%. The highest one being Random Forest, Hence is used as the model for the predicting function on the bottom of the notebook.
